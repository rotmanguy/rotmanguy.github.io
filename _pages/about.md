Senior NLP Reseacher at Gong.io.

Formerly, I completed my Ph.D. studies as a member of the Natural Language Processing Group, supervised by <a href = "https://ie.technion.ac.il/~roiri/">Roi Reichart</a>, at the <a href = "http://ie.technion.ac.il">Faculty of Industrial Engineering and Management</a> at the <a href = "http://www.technion.ac.il">Technion - Israel Institute of Technology</a>. 

My research focuses on structured learning for low-resource natural language processing. My research interests are domain adaptation, cross-lingual settings, semi and self-supervised learning, model compression and model calibration.
