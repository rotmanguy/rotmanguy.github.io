I am a Ph.D. Student in the Natural Language Processing Group, supervised by <a href = "https://ie.technion.ac.il/~roiri/">Roi Reichart</a>, at the <a href = "http://ie.technion.ac.il">Faculty of Industrial Engineering and Management</a> at the <a href = "http://www.technion.ac.il">Technion - Israel Institute of Technology</a>. 

My research focuses on structured learning for low-resource natural language processing. My research interests are domain adaptation, cross-lingual settings, semi and self-supervised learning, model compression and model calibration.

Please check out our upcoming <a href = "https://2021.eacl.org/">EACL 2021</a> workshop on <a href = "https://adapt-nlp.github.io/Adapt-NLP-2021/">Domain Adaptation in Natural Language Processing</a>!
